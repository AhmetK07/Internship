# AYVOS-Internship
Here is the workflow of the code:

1. You place your desired video to be cropped at the Videos folder
2. The code creates a save folder 
3. Within the save folder there will be folders created in the name of the videos.
4. Within those folders there will be files that are named after the exact frame of the picture than an unique id of the frames.
